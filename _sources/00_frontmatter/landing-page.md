## Rationale

As scientists and engineers we use physical models to solve problems. Leveraging
fundamental principles, we can link controllable variables to desired outcomes
in applications like designing safe aircraft structures, renewable energy
systems, and nuclear waste disposal facilities. However, in all of these systems
there are unavoidable sources of uncertainty: manufacturing variation,
fluctuating environmental conditions, and a lack of comprehensive physical
principles.

A traditional approach to these uncertainties is to throw up one's hands,
pretend uncertainty does not exist, and slap a safety factor on the analysis.
This book is about treating uncertainty with the same level of rigor with which
we treat physics. Modern techniques in uncertainty quantification (UQ) enable
the modeling and assessment of noise and variability. With UQ tools, you can
minimize failure rates, distinguish between important and irrelevant
uncertainties, and overcome missing physics.

This book is a collection of reproducible case studies on applying UQ to solve
science and engineering problems. You will learn to apply advanced UQ techniques
in a meaningful context using a Python software package for model analysis under
uncertainty---[Grama](https://github.com/zdelrosario/py_grama). Learning this
computational toolkit will allow you to easily adapt and extend these techniques
to your own problems, equipping you to model and predict with confidence.
